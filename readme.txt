sol - a game about getting ready for summer

This game is a much more watered down version of what I wanted to make, but I wanted to make this within two days.

My inspiration for this game was making something simple, but also crazy impressive for two day's work. I pretty much
had to power through a headache to get this done in time.

Goal:
Collect all six summer items from around your house.

Controls:
W - Move forward
A - Move left
S - Move down
D - Move right
SPACE - Interact
ESC - Open menu

Installation:
The LWJGL dependencies I'm using account for Linux, Windows and Mac on x64. You just need to put the .jar file in a
folder you know, and run:
TODO: add the run command

This project was developed using Java 11 with Oracle OpenJDK 11 on Arch Linux 5.17.5 linux-zen. If the file won't run
with the Oracle JRE, try running it with OpenJDK. I probably won't test this on Windows.

Building:
This project uses Gradle, because IntelliJ. Have fun figuring it out.

Disclaimer:
I try to make very clean code, but sometimes things slip through the cracks. Any errors there are should fail
spectacularly, and you'll probably know what went wrong (the rendering engine should be stable, so if there's a
segfault, whoopsie)
